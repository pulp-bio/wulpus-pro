# WULPUS PRO v0.1.0
## A base platform for Wearable Ultra Low Power Ultrasound

# Introduction

This repository contains the work in progress on the WULPUS PRO ultrasound platform, a successor of the [WULPUS Project](https://github.com/pulp-bio/wulpus)

WULPUS PRO is a compact base platform for an ultra low power ultrasound sensing, featuring the following specifications:
- **16 channels** (time-multiplexed)
- **30 V** unipolar excitations with programmable frequency (100 kHz - 10 MHz)
- **Indirect and Direct Bias** (-30 V up to 30 V) for CMUT transducers
- **30.8 dB** Programable-Gain Amplifier + **80 dB** external VGA
- **Programmable** linear Time Gain Compesation Profiles
- **Optional** Envelope Extractor, runtime configurable
- **8 Msps** Analog-to-Digital converter (12 bit resolution)
- **SPI (8 MHz)** host MCU interface
- **Compactness and light weight** (40 x 20 mm footprint)
- **Ultra-Low Power** consumption of **<25 mW**

- `hw`, containing the CAD source files for 
    - WULPUS PRO Acquisition PCB (located at `hw/wulpus_pro_acq_pcb_dev_board`)
    - WULPUS adapter PCB for polyCMUT transducer (located at `hw/wulpus_polycmut_adapter`)

- `docs`, containing the project documentation (Work in Progress)

# Documentation 

WULPUS PRO build up on the top of the original WULPUS platfrom. Therefore, please refer to the original [WULPUS User Manual](docs/wulpus_user_manual.pdf) for assembly instructions, example measurements and GUI overview.

# How to reproduce?

To build and run your own instance of the **WULPUS PRO** platform, follow the steps below:

### 1. Manufacture and Assemble the Hardware

Produce the **WULPUS PRO acquisition development board** using the design files in:

- `hw/wulpus_pro_acq_pcb_dev_board`
- (Optionally) `hw/wulpus_polycmut_adapter`

Assemble the PCB using the provided schematics and BOMs.

### 2. Interconnect with nRF52 DK

Use the following pin mapping to connect the WULPUS PRO acquisition board to the **nRF52 DK**:

| **Signal**         | **nRF52 DK Pin** | **WULPUS PRO Connector Pin** |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `SPI_SS`           | P0.04            | X3.4                          |
| `SPI_CLK`          | P0.29            | X3.3                          |
| `SPI_MISO`         | P0.30            | X3.1                          |
| `SPI_MOSI`         | P0.31            | X3.2                          |
| `Data_ready`       | P0.24            | X4.2                          |
| `BLE_conn_ready`   | P0.25            | X4.3                          |

### 3. Flash the MSP430 Firmware

Navigate to `fw/msp430/` and follow instructions to:

- Set up Code Composer Studio
- Compile the firmware
- Flash the MSP430 MCU

### 4. Flash the nRF52 DK and USB Dongle

Go to `fw/nrf52/` to:

- Set up Segger Studio and nRF Connect SDK
- Compile and flash:
  - nRF52832 DK (`ble_peripheral`)
  - nRF52840 USB dongle (`peripheral`)

### 5. Set Up the Python GUI

1. [Install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Go to the `sw` folder (contains `requirements.yml`)
3. Open terminal (Anaconda Prompt on Windows), run:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f requirements.yml
   conda activate wulpus_env
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## How to use?

To start a measurement with **WULPUS PRO**, follow these steps:

1. **Plug in the USB dongle** and **power the nRF52 DK** via USB.
2. **Check the dongle connection** (green LED should light up).  
   If not, press the **reset button on the nRF52 DK**, then try again.
3. **Only after confirming** dongle connectivity, **power the WULPUS PRO board** (via connector or debug pin headers).
4. Open a **Conda terminal**, activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate wulpus_env
   ```

5. Then navigate to the `sw/` folder and open `wulpus_pro_gui.ipynb`. Follow the notebook instructions to begin acquisition.
