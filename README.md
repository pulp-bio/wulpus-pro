# WULPUS PRO v0.1.0
## Wearable Ultra Low-Power Ultrasound PRO

# Introduction

This repository contains the work in progress on the WULPUS PRO ultrasound platform.

<!-- WULPUS is a truly wearable ultra-low-power open research ultrasound platform. 

The probe has the following features:
- **8 channels** (time-multiplexed)
- **8 Msps** Analog-to-Digital converter (12 bit resolution)
- **30.8 dB** Programable-Gain Amplifier + **10 dB** Operational Amplifier
- **Bluetooth Low Energy** (BLE) wireless link (320 kbps throughput)
- Up to **50 acquisitions per-second** (APS) (400 samples per acquisition, raw data streaming mode)
- **Compactness and light weight** (46 x 25 mm footprint, 9 g)
- **Ultra-Low Power** consumption of **22 mW** (raw data streaming mode, 50 APS) -->

# Structure of the repository

This repository has the following folders:

- `fw`, containing the firmware source code, namely:
    - source code for the nRF52832 MCU of the nRF52 DK, located at `fw/nrf52/ble_peripheral/US_probe_nRF52_firmware`
    - source code for the nRF52840 USB dongle, located at `fw/nrf52/peripheral/US_probe_dongle_firmware`
    - source code for the MSP430 ultrasound MCU, located at `fw/msp430`
- `sw`, containing the Python code for the WULPUS Pro Graphical User Interface

- `sim`, containing the LTSpice simulation files for WULPUS PRO analog fron end
 
- `hw`, containing the CAD source files for 
    - WULPUS PRO Acquisition PCB (located at `hw/wulpus_pro_acq_pcb_dev_board`)
    - WULPUS adapter PCB for polyCMUT transducer (located at `hw/wulpus_polycmut_adapter`)

- `docs`, containing the project documentation (e.g., images of the device, user manual, ...)

<!-- # Documentation 

The comprehensive [WULPUS User Manual](docs/wulpus_user_manual.pdf) can be found in the `docs/` folder. It covers everything about WULPUS, from assembly instructions to example measurements and troubleshooting, making the platform user-friendly for everyone, regardless of technical expertise. -->

# How to reproduce?

<!-- Please find the detailed instructions in chapter 2 of the [WULPUS User Manual](docs/wulpus_user_manual.pdf). -->

In a nutshell, to build your own instance of WULPUS PRO, the following steps should be completed:
1. *PCBs manufacturing and assembly*<br>
   You can find the design files (Altium source files, schematics, bills of materials) under the `hw` folder.
2. *Flashing MSP430 firmware*<br>
   You can find the instructions on seting-up the toolchain, compiling the firmware and flashing the MSP430 MCU in the `fw/msp430` folder.
3. *Flashing nRF52 DK and USB dongle firmware*<br>
   You can find the instructions on setting-up the toolchain, compiling the firmware, flashing the nRF52 MCU and USB dongle in the `fw/nrf52` folder.
4. *Python dependencies installation on the host PC*<br>
   Follow the instructions in the `sw` folder to install the dependencies.

# Usage

<!-- Please refer to chapter 3 of the [WULPUS User Manual](docs/wulpus_user_manual.pdf) for detailed information. -->

Starting a measurement with WULPUS Pro can be accomplished in three simple steps:
- Power up the probe, either from the connector or via debug pinheaders
- Connect the USB dongle to the host PC
- Activate the Python environent, launch the Jupyter notebook located in `sw` folder, and follow the instructions in the notebook
